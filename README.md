*Important* Common errors on setting up python environemnt:

- When you see `>>>`, you are *inside* python environment. You cannot
  run commands such as `pip` here. To run commands, you need to exit
  python environment by typing `exit()` and type Enter.
- If `python` or `pip` command does not work, try `python3` and `pip3`
- To avoid tricky problems, use jupyter notebook intead of command
  line interface. It is much nicer.
