    "As we will see later in this class, everything a computer does is computing. Things that are not obviously numbers are actually stored as numbers in computers, including the splash of water in a video game, or a font of text. Hence, a computer program is just a sequence of manipulations on numbers. In this sense, a computer program is no different from a sequence of computing steps that you punch into a calculator. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you wanna compute the total payment for a house of $100,000 at a 4.25\\% annual rate for a 30-year mortgage, here is an expression you enter in a calculator or a computer: \n",
    "\n",
    "100000 * (1+0.0425) ** 30\n",

    "However, computing can easily be way more complex and tedious than the example above. Unlike a calculator, a computer does not require you to punch keys for all compuating steps again should you need solve the same computing problem again. Instead, you can store the program and just load and execute it when needed -- this is what happens when you power up your phone or when you launch an app on your phone. This idea is known as the **stored-program computer**. Yes, some calculators allow you to store the program to reuse later.\n",
    "\n",
    "A benefit of the stored-program computer is that you can run the repeat computing tasks with different inputs, from users, sensors, etc. You can load the same program into the computer and the program will behave different depending on the input. If you do not store the program, you'd have to key in every time but tailor with the inputs for each particular case. Just imagine how you would computer different total payments for different houses of different mortgage lengths and rates. If you were running a real estate company, you definitely want a computer rather than a calculator, the latter of which requires you to also hire many human operators to push keys."
