    "# Why functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the example earlier where we calculate the interest\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "principal * (1 - interest_rate) ** years  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To save time from typing the same expression, usually lengthy, repetitively, we introduce functions. You may imagine that the relation between a function and a block of code as the relation between a variable and different values it can take. For example, if the expression above is the output of a function `total_payment(x,y,z)`, then plugging in the right 3 variables into the function will give you the total payment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Function introduces several benefits to computer programming:\n",
    "1. It saves time and space to repetitively type the same piece of code. If you wanna change the expression, just change the function definition once, instead of changing all occurences of the expression. \n",
    "2. It breaks a program into parts that are independent to each other but can be pipelined together to achieve a greater task. This idea is called **modularization**. You can replace or update a function without worrying about whether the program will still work as long as the interface between the function to the rest of the program remains. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Functions in math\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, a function is a mapping from variables to variables.  In math class, we define function like this $f(x) = x + 2$ with an assumption that $x\\in \\mathbb{R}$, i.e., a real number. The function $f$ maps a real number to a real number, denoted as $f: \\mathbb{R}\\mapsto \\mathbb{R}$. The variable $x$ is called the **argument** (or **input**) which you can treat as a placeholder. The expression $x+1$ is the **definition** of the function $f$.  When the argument is subsituted with a constant, the function outputs a value that can be evaluated by substituting the argument with the constant,  e.g., $f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3$. Of course, the argument can be subsitituted with any expression, e.g., $f(3+1) = f(4) = 4 + 1 = 5$, $f(y^2) = y^2 +1$, or even $f(f(5)) = f (5+1) = (5+1)+1 = 7$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A function can have more than one arguments and more than one outputs. For example, $g(x,y) = x + y $ and $h(x,y) = y - x $. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Functions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function definitions \n",
    "The translation from a math function to a Pythonic function is very straightforward. For example, the above function $f$ can be turned into Python as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def f(x):\n",
    "  return x + 1 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you explicitly state a function definition with the keyword `def`, which is followed by the function name. The arguments are listed in a pair of parenthesis following the function name, separated with commas. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then what the function does on the arguments form the **function body**. In Python, you must explictly delimit the function body by indenting all lines of it. A line that is vertically aligned with the `def` line means the end of your function definition. \n",
    "\n",
    "The output of a function must be explicitly stated with a **return statement**. The return statement begins with the keyword `return` followed by an expression. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is one definition of the function to compute the total payment of a loan given the annual interest rate, the principal, and years of the loan:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def total_payment(interest_rate, principal, years):\n",
    "    return principal * (1 + interest_rate) ** years  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the body of a function does not necessarily need to be just one `return` statement. It can be anything allowed. For example, here is another definition of the function `total_payment`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def total_payment(interest_rate, principal, years):\n",
    "    folds = * (1 + interest_rate) ** years)\n",
    "    total_amount = principal * folds \n",
    "    return total_amount \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike in math, Python allows a function to have no inputs nor outputs. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def happy():\n",
    "    print (\"I am happy\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "def happy2(x):\n",
    "    print (\"I am happy\"*2)\n",
    "    \n",
    "def happy3():\n",
    "    return 0 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function calls \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of using a function in computer programming is called a **function call**. To **call a function**, just put an expression in the place of an argument, e.g., \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "f(3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The operation of using an expression in the place of an argument is called **passing** a value to the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if the expression has no value, i.e., **undefined**, passing it to a function will result an error because the body of the function cannot be execute unless all needed variables have values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's see some examples. "
